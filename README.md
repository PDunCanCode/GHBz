A pre-"Create-React-App" experience. One I'd personally not like to revisit. This would be an introductory dive into "Vanilla" React lead by Tyler McGinnis, overall very informative, but felt soulcrushing and frustrating after I have learned the magic of "Create-React-App" and have learned React patterns on newer (16.7+) versions of React. 

I built this out from scratch with NPM Init, had to code line by line the Package.JSON to handle Webpack & babel. OMG the HORROR!! Everything about building this app felt far more dfficult than it had to be. This coding experience gave me a new appreciation for how far React has come even in just this past year. 

Overall, this is the app:

Hits and fetches repo information from the Github API, it then does some maths and ranks the Repos based on Popularity, additionally there is a Github user Battle feature which fetches two Github users profile data, more magic maths assigns a score and compares those profiles. A winner emmerges. 

From here, I am diving deeper into Javascript, then revisiting both this courses sequel on Hooks, and digging deeper into Context API, and Hooks with Pauz, where I am excited to get back into the newer features of React and building my knowledge in Databases with GraphQL, and Apollo, and SQL. (eventually)
